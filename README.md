# The Odin Project - Battleship

Project practicing TDD to make a battleship game.

# ToDo

- Add Random ship placement event listener for player, but computer should do it on initialization. 
- Need to add an array to contain all the ships to be placed. 
- Stop computer ships from being shown. Do this once the random ship placement has been sorted. 
- Maybe needs isGameRunning property to stop attacks been sent before ship placement and after the game has ended. 



- remove the missedAttacks array as not using it.
